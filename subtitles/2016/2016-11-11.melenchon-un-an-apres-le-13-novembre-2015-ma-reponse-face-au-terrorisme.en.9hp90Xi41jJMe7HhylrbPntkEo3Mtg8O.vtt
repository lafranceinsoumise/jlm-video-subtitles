00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
We said and repeated that this conference was a step in the campaign.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.820
A lot of work has already been accomplished.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.020
A document was already published for discussion, and I hope that it will not be discussed by professionals only,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.400
but also by citizens in general since they are directly concerned with this issue.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.200
A lot of people intervened in the organization of today's conference,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:42.200
either on behalf of their union, or on behalf of their own personal expertise, be it academic or else.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.120
Of course, today's participants are not necessarily members of La France Insoumise's campaign,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.460
nor do they necessarily advocate its programme.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.480
I therefore thank them for taking part in this conference

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.120
and I have an opinion on the reasons why they did it, because this was not usual in the past.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.100
The reason is that a lot of the great public services

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.500
that are part of the dignity and purpose of the republican state - because ultimately, that's what the state is all about -

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.520
i.e. a collective organization at the service of some principles,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.840
and in order to be implemented, these principles need public services that will serve them.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.780
Today, these services, authorities or institutions are all in danger.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.120
Not only for their own sake, since the state is collapsing,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.620
but also for the sake of the aims they are supposed to serve but do not serve anymore

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.420
because of a lack of means, and that is not the only aspect of the problem.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.220
The lack of means is not the only aspect that shows that the republican state's authority is collapsing,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.460
there is also the doctrine of the use of forces and institutions

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.380
that contribute to the existence of the nation.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.720
This ideological issue has become so essential

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.160
that all these civil servants feel the need to get on the stage and alert the public opinion.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.300
What in the past pertained to union action only

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.300
- although there's always been a link between union action and the public interest -

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.800
has now become a much more widespread issue.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.200
People therefore feel the need to alert the public opinion.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.800
And there is no better moment to do this than an electoral campaign,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.380
the presidential election in particaular.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.060
In what I call the "presidential monarchy" of the Fifth Republic, the presidential election

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.460
is the focus of all attention and all the powers.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.240
I therefore encourage all those who deal with important issues for the whole of society

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.620
to get involved and to get on the stage,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.180
to have a say, to alert, to explain and to make propositions to the public opinion.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.220
We should raise the level of awareness of our citizens who are now incited

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.340
to react rather than think.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.460
Citizens are incited to act according to their compulsions and emotions

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.840
rather than according to their own reason and judgement.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.260
We are offering a policy of reason and judgement.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.120
It is to me as spectacular as compulsion and emotion,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.140
and above all more efficient than the braggings that I have witnessed for so many years.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.840
My age and experience is my strength.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.200
I spent a lot of years in Parliament.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.100
I therefore witnessed all sorts of braggings.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.660
I cannot count the laws and measures on terrorism that were adopted.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.880
By the way, the definition of terrorism has changed a lot in the course of the last twenty years.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.980
When I was first elected as senator in 1986, the terrorists were the Kanak separatists.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.300
I am therefore well aware of how easy it is to pretend to be doing a lot of things

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.500
and how easily feebleminded people can be impressed.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.020
I know reason has a cost, it requires patience and time, but it is more efficient

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.340
and it enables us to make fewer mistakes, and to be less confused and engaged in useless struggles.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.820
You have to get on the stage, whoever you are, whatever your opinions.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.280
I or my friends might not share your opionion,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.000
but speak your mind, say what you think would be good for our country.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.600
I just mentioned the importance of being experienced on this matter,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.000
but being experienced on this matter during an electoral campaign is also important

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.440
The great meeting of the 18th March 2012

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:42.200
represented the height of my campaign. It shed light on social issues, the core of all other issues,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:52.040
but was supplanted the day after by a far-reaching event that gave rise to all sorts of pointless statements.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.440
This event completely disrupted the election. We tend to forget about this.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:06.980
Some said that my insufficient result in 2012, that was quite remarkable by the way, was due to my character

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.240
to the posters we designed or things of the sort.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.040
In truth, the rise of the far right at this point of the campaign

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.560
was due to this event

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.020
and because the authorities reacted in a way that justified the far right's reasoning.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.000
After all, we live in a democracy.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.820
What was this event? It was the murders committed by Mohamed Merah.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.900
These murders completely disrupted the 2012 presidential election.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:51.760
It turned the issues of violence and mass murders, of racist murders,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:00.440
into THE issue that superseded all other issues and prevented citizens from thinking the issue of security.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:14.680
This morning, you saw people giving their opinion in front of an assembly that aims at thinking.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:21.820
This doesn't mean that they are involved in my campaign or that they agree with me.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.100
But I must say that some do agree with me.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.120
This comes from the fact that my friends and I worked on and became aware of issues of security.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:43.200
My friend François Delapierre worked with police and security services and published this book,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:51.900
which was followed by other works and meetings, and this book's doctrine was gradually improved.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:58.460
This book is the basis of my doctrine on security issues.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:04.080
There is also this issue of the National Defence Review entitled "Towards a New Independency"

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:14.600
that encapsulates our work during the conferences on defence Djordje Kuzmanovic, who spoke earlier, and I organized.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.120
Since then a special group is working on these issues, you saw them today:

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:29.660
Lise Maillard and Ugo Bernalicis who spoke and introduced the participants earlier.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.180
In the course of January or February, I will introduce a broader working group

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:43.700
that will be in charge of concluding the report we began working on.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.720
They will organize legislative working groups as well.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:55.140
What my opponents should be afraid of is that I intend to do what I say I'll do.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.100
And I intend to do this quickly.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:04.540
Not only because I believe in what I say, I heard this was unusual nowadays,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:11.280
but this is not new for those who are used to think issues through.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.160
The story goes that Mirabeau said of Robespierre:

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.740
"This guy is frightening. He believes in what he says".

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.720
Well I believe in what I say.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:28.960
We'll be ready to get to work as soon as we have to.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:34.120
The doctrine will be ready, the men and women who'll have to apply it will be ready,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.640
and the method for governing will be ready.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.960
This is not the issue here,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:50.800
but the state is going through a crisis so intense that we have to think about rebuilding it, of course,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:58.580
but we also have to think about rebuilding our conception of the police from start to finish.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.720
From start to finish.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.860
Because we satisfied ourselves with applying sticking plasters and repair patches on wooden legs

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:17.580
we are now in a situation where, as policemen describe it, policies create reality.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.120
In other words, we are ticking all the boxes

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.120
that are supposed to be the true situation of security and criminality in this country.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:35.920
Maybe quantum physicists will be delighted, but as far as the management of public affairs is concerned,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:42.440
it is extremely dangerous to think that reality is what we think it is.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:52.900
We will have to explain and get across to police services the reasons why we want to reshape them from start to finish,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:11:00.600
and this will not only be concerned with the  organization of the state, but also with the structure of the government.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.580
Maybe that the system of the almighty state secretaries,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.640
all the more mighty that they are powerless,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.320
meaning that they run so considerable administrations,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.280
administrations that never stop fighting with one another,

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.620
that state secretaries are but temporary problems

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:30.140
during the top officials' carrer paths and the struggles between services.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.120
These state secretaries did not guarantee the authority of the state.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.660
On the contrary, they weakened it.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:45.660
And today we figure out that we should intervene more subtly, meaning more politically,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.540
at each level of the state.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:56.420
We no doubt need High Commissioners more than we need secretaries today.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:05.640
High Commissioners are men and women who are appointed for a specific mission during a specific period.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.340
They would get to work as soon as we would be in office.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:22.060
If my friends and I held conferences on the issue of defence,

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:30.580
if policemen were involved in the preparation of our report,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:36.500
as well as magistrates - although the issue of justice is another subject to be dealt with separately -

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:42.700
it is because some people among policemen, soldiers and magistrates

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:48.920
chose to join us in our struggle.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:55.460
Often, they don't have the possibility to do this openly because of their duties.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.620
I'm not asking them to do so.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:08.240
We must respect the obligations of service that are connected to the duties of so demanding domains.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.780
But when the time comes, some of them will get involved openly.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:21.840
so that everyone of you may understand that something new is happening in the traditional political field.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:30.480
This is what François Pirelli said earlier - that's his alias right? I don't want to reveal any secret.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:41.900
This means that until now, it is true that our school of thought has often been attached, and rightly,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:49.820
to the issue of justice and to the way it was meted out,

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:57.040
without forgetting that justice is administered in the name of the French people to apply the laws it voted.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:03.860
A judge has a personal opinion on how to enforce the law, but the law rules.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:10.780
This was comfortable, since we could see how to get involved in these issues directly.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:22.240
Besides justice, whose number one function is to guarantee individual freedoms,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:27.460
within the balance of the republican society,

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.500
used to be the sole object of our attention.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:38.120
I'm not saying that judges liked us so much - although some did

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.720
and there is a debate among magistrates -

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:53.200
but being interested in police and military issues was much more unusual.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.220
But the police and the army are made of citizens

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.820
who think about all the problems of our society.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:10.820
They may even be more competent to understand the consequences of these problems on society's stability,

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.280
because petty criminality, that focuses a lot of attention,

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.480
is a symptom of the consequences of a set of facts on society.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.720
Of course, individuals are always liable for their actions,

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.280
and as far as I'm concerned, I not only believe this,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:34.300
but individual responsibility is to me a philosophical principle of the Republic.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:44.720
It is a new phenomenon that generals, admirals, colonels,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:53.120
either because they are no longer in service and feel therefore freer to act, or still in service,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.600
want to meet us and think we are a fulcrum.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:05.520
Likewise in the police, at every level. And I want to state this solemnly, I am your fulcrum.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:12.440
It is true that debates and ideological choices exist in each of these bodies,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.880
and this is normal in a democratic society.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.840
Policemen and soldiers are not robots,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.180
and neither are judges, although some politicians wanted them to enforce the law automatically.

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:32.260
Society is made of human beings, which means that policemen, soldiers and magistrates don't share the same opinions.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:39.520
You have personal and political opinions

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.260
that lead you to express yourself because the state is undergoing a crisis.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:58.320
Many of you understood that the Siamese twins, meaning the Socialist Party and the Republicans,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.020
who led the state to decompose,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:08.700
who used your authority without any purpose but their career,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.760
so much so that most of you no longer trust them...

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.960
I am opposed to the idea that there is only one solution to this problem.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:28.940
Many of you know that as the rest of society, the police and the army can choose the far right.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.060
But I want you to know that it is also possible to choose the far Republic that I embody.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:42.140
Consequently, you can choose La France Insoumise and I as a fulcrum

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:48.440
to resist against illegitimate orders and against a conception of the doctrine of the use of military forces

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.040
that does not correspond to the republican ideal.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.320
You can use us as a fulcrum.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.420
This is a new aspect.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:04.480
I am well aware that it will be a problem for a part of my political family.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.720
I was criticized for giving my opinion on this incredible situation

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.600
in which policemen demonstrated at night

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.180
and went so far as to demonstrate in front of the Elysée Palace.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:24.600
This behavior does not correspond to what the police is supposed to do.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.320
For multiple reasons, some limits cannot be crossed in this country,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.640
like the threshold of a nuclear power plant or that of the seat of power of the Republic.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:44.120
Police or military forces cannot walk around such facilities if they are not ordered to do so.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:51.360
I perfectly understood that demonstrators were not planning a coup d'état,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.020
but such is the situation today, and this is a serious problem.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:09.900
It is irresponsible to class policemen in distress, who are humiliated and who fear the future, as members of the far right.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:16.280
Most of them don't have anything to do with the far right, nor do their demonstrations.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.900
This is why I met my responsibilities in saying that this situation was very serious.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:24.020
I don't want to lessen the importance of the situation,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:29.920
and I think that policemen deserved better than an appointment  with the President, a meeting that was immediately accepted,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:37.120
whereas people demonstrated against the labor law for months and were unable to achieve any goal.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.380
The role of the President of the Republic is not to have an appointment with demonstrators.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.060
That's my opinion. Sometimes maybe, in specific circumstances...

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:53.080
But policemen deserved better. They deserved to be understood.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.660
The republican identity of the state is at stake here,

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.300
because the workforce that is supposed to guarantee its security thinks it can defy its authority.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.620
The state is in danger, because it is collapsing.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:18.080
And this frightens the civil servants who are on the front line to defend it. This is the situation we must face.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:25.300
I think that the work we began gives clear-cut answers to their preoccupations, too much sometimes,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:31.740
but I cannot prevent those who want to work from working.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.400
As you know, the more precise we are, the more we can be criticized.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.480
Those who woud set to read my propositions might discover in p. 54

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.680
that such and such aspect does not correspond to what they think would be a good solution,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.220
which could make them get on their high horse, thereby creating endless controversies.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.080
I hope this won't be the case.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:58.200
Now I'm leaving aside police issues because I want to say something about counter-terrorism

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:08.000
since the anniversary of the mass slaughters of the 13th of November is getting closer.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.580
I want my opinion on the subject to be understood as clearly as possible.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:19.260
But previous to that, I would like to show

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:28.780
that although it was intellectually comfortable to make a connection between

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:35.400
petty criminality in those suburban areas that are continually accused,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.500
and terrorism, even if the proof of the connection between the two was never established,

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:48.380
except for rare cases here and there of disturbed, alcoholic people,

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:56.100
many of which were also drug addicts,

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.280
who began practicing religion just before committing murders.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:06.200
Besides the form of religion they practiced was improbable and did not correspond to anything in the Koran,

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.640
as was the case in Nice. The proof of this connection was never established.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:19.760
However, we are able to show and to prove that there is a real connection

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:30.060
between serious criminality, money laundering financial circuits and  the misdeeds of the enemies of our country.

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:40.380
Interestingly enough, no one ever hears that any financial circuit is discovered and destroyed,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.040
circuits that enable some people to buy weapons - because weapons are no free -

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:51.360
to rent cars, appartments and so on.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.720
These financial circuits have to do with criminality.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:04.700
And as was shown earlier, these criminal networks are often the same as official networks.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:18.020
The same people handle the money of crime, prostitution, drugs, murders and terrorism.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:24.720
Our interest is therefore to fight these networks.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:36.920
And since we are dealing with terrorism this morning, no one will make us forget that

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:45.520
if terrorist do exist, they are always connected with specific conflicts.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.240
There is always a link with specific conflicts.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.040
All the the terrorist attacks that was perpetrated against our country

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.560
were all connected with specific conflicts

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.980
These terrorists have always claimed to be part of these conflicts.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:10.460
Therefore, this connection should be our priority, everyone probably agrees with me.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:20.580
But the most obvious and visible manifestation of this connection is money!

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:27.580
ISIS was able to pay its soldiers and murderers only because it had money,

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.180
and it collected that money in Iraq and Syria

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.380
by taxing people there,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:39.100
and through the exploitation of local resources

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:51.180
with the help of some organizations, like Lafarge, the corporation, as was revealed by Le Monde,

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.480
but I'm more specifically talking about certain states.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:03.660
Ladies and gentlemen, someone transported the oil that was produced in Iraq and Syria

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.560
it did not move by itself.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.380
Trucks were used,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:14.960
and people had to load, drive and unload these trucks,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:20.480
and then load some boats and drive them from one harbor to another.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:29.540
These networks are not digital, mysterious or whirling around in the air

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.840
to the extent that they cannot be stopped and arrested.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.160
Harbors, boats and trucks are a physical reality, aren't they?

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:44.600
Well these networks involve states, companies and financial circuits,

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:50.360
and we know who they are!

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:59.780
Turkey, the turkish government, the president of Turkey, and more precisely his son-in-law,

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:07.720
who was accused of organizing these traffics by the turkish social democrat party.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:16.060
And until the Russian intervention that consisted in bombing the pipelines from oil wells to the border with Turkey,

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:27.840
no one did anything but brag and accuse bike thieves of being terrorists

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:34.000
that have the ability of transporting oil around the world.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.080
I said this with a dose of irony, but this is an outrageous situation.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:46.800
Tracing the financial circuits that finance terrorist attacks is necessary,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:57.840
and fighting them requires judicial and police services - in order to stop the trafics that enable terrorist attacks -

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.660
and geopolitics.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:05.120
We cannot be the allies - within a military alliance -

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.940
of people who organize and finance murders in our country.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:15.340
We cannot be allied to Turkey when it shoots in the back of the Kurds,

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:21.080
who are our main allies on the field in the fight against

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:30.940
the fascist ideology embodied by organizations such as ISIS, Al Nusra and other fanatical organizations.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:40.160
We must therefore clean out the geopolitical roots of terrorism. This is efficient.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:48.520
Chasing everything that moves with an absurd logic is inefficient, a logic that magistrates described very well,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.940
that consists in punishing behaviors rather than acts.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:28:06.860
For instance, after the horrible events in Nice, who were said to be committed by ISIS,

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:13.500
authorities emphasized the issue of the burkini

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.680
and mixed issues that pertain to law and the enforcement of law,

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.700
with issues of ideological committment. Yes, some people can be opposed to the burkini,

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:33.020
but this pertains to ideological reasons, not to legal issues.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:42.240
This was proven when legal decisions repealed illegal political decisions on this issue.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:49.620
An absurd situation was created, in which authorities showed they were powerless.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:55.680
Nothing is worse than showing that authorities are powerless.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.200
This leads me to my second point.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:06.000
If we consider "terrorism" as the enemy - and I don't think it is,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.240
I think our enemies are terrorists, meaning those who commit terrorist attacks -

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.920
well if it is our enemy indeed,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.620
if we repeat over and over that we are "at war",

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.420
then we should consequently apply a logic of war.

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.080
Of course we should not!

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.920
But we are doing it, in an undisciplined and unefficient way.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.900
It is time that the soldiers of the "Sentinelle" operation go back to their barracks.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.540
We are exhausting them for nothing.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.480
We are using the demonstration of force in an absurd way.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:52.800
Who believes that these soldiers could use their war equipment in the middle of a crowd

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.860
in train stations or in front of schools?

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:06.040
This is not a way of solving problems, we all know this.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:12.880
The army is therefore reduced to do patrols

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:19.240
and these soldiers suffer from this situation that can be read in the eyes of the people they bump into.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.800
Secondly, if we fight an enemy,

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:30.040
the basic rule consists in not admitting he won, especially when he does not ask that.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.200
And yet, we did that on many occasions,

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:43.100
during the horrible attack in Nice in particular.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:49.960
Finally, we cannot afford to enable him to reach his objectives,

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.980
for a terrorist attack does have an objective.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.380
This objective is not just to achieve a mass murder

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:06.120
for which is hired such and such dangerous, psychopath, criminal, lunatic.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:13.140
This objective is a political outcome, and it is this political outcome that we have to fight.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:21.960
I repeat, an attack has a political objective, and we have to prevent this objective from succeeding,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.300
when it was not possible to prevent the terrorist attack.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:34.860
By the way, I often hear that some terrorist attacks were prevented.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.980
I do have the certainty that security services are doing all they can,

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.840
and I want to show my solidarity.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.580
I don't belong to the category of the know-it-alls

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.860
who know what should have been done better than those who acted after an event occurred.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:54.820
However, let me ask this question,

00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:01.760
if terrorist attacks were prevented, it means we know who wanted to commit them.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.300
Where are they?

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.500
Planning a terrorist attack is not a behavior, it is an act.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.300
Where are they? Was someone convicted?

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.360
Was someone accused of planning an attack held on remand? Nobody was!

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:26.860
Terrorist attacks were apparently prevented, but we do not know who planned these attacks, and no one was sentenced. Why?

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:33.200
Were they taken into custody in secret prisons, as North-Americans like to do it?

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.860
The main aspect of secret prisons is that they are absolutely inefficient.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:47.320
Did the Guantanamo totrure camp ever prevent the spreading of terrorism anywhere in the world? It did not.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:56.700
Did the CIA's secret prisons in Europe ever prevent any of the attacks in Europe? They did not.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:04.900
Therefore, if those who were planning to commit criminal acts,

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:12.660
were arrested but were not brought to justice, this is a problem, and we would like to know where they are now.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:17.760
Or maybe the President decided to have them assassinated abroad,

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.840
since a recently published book informed us that

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:27.060
the President of the Republic gave the order to assassinate at least four people.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:33.840
He said at least four, maybe there were more, he does not even remember.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.940
He said at least four people, maybe there were six.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:44.140
As far as murders are concerned, counting them is apparently not an issue.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.780
But this leaves us with a question.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.160
Who was killed? For what reason?

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.340
What attacks were planned against France? We would like to know.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:34:01.400
Maybe deciding of committing a murder is an attitude that is morally acceptable,

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.920
this is a specific philosophical issue, but is it efficient?

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:12.440
Why were those who we supposedly killed not arrested?

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:18.720
If we had the possibility to get close enough to kill them methodically, we undoubtedly could have arrested them.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:26.660
And if we had arrested them, we could have brought them to justice in order to question them

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:30.360
about the plans against us.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:34.780
You see, many of the pointless statements that we witnessed

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:41.080
are above all a sign of the powerlessness of authorities to deal with this situation.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:45.560
I said that...

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:55.360
we needed to cut every link that make terrorist attacks possible one by one.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.000
I think I already said that it was not the case today.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.820
When and where were financial circuits identified and destroyed?

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:11.500
Why were potential criminals assassinated and not arrested?

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:21.200
How come that we stagnate in such inefficiency after so many bombastic statements?

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:30.120
I read - it might not be true but I read it - in newspapers that claim to be well-informed

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:36.440
that one person in two who went to fight us in the Middle East,

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:41.180
is not investigated on coming back to France.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.900
How is such a thing possible?

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.720
How can someone who fought against us...

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:52.940
And I would even include anyone who served in a foreign army,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:36:02.060
who therefore took on all the logic and the interests of an army that is not ours.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:11.080
How come that these people come back without being questioned about what they did and where they were?

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:19.620
How come that it doesn't seem to be a problem that one in two of them is not investigated?

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:26.200
Veterans in general, as experience has shown, develop specific psychological syndromes.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.660
North-Americans know this phenomenon from the veterans of the Vietnam War.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:37.780
War is a specific organization of crime.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.280
An army prepares itself to kill as many people as possible, who in turn do the same.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:49.120
This activity cannot be described as facilitating the psychological balance of soldiers,

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.800
of soldiers on the front line in particular.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.080
Killing goes against a deep instinct in human beings,

00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.920
which explains why warfare cannot be organized otherwise than through all sorts of rituals

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.620
that are supposed to relieve individuals of the psychological pressure that is exerted on them.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:15.880
The issue of people who fought against us and come back from a war is therefore to be dealt with very seriously.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:21.380
It is not a groundless suspicion.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:27.960
I believe that anyone who served in a foreign army should be questioned on coming back to France,

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.060
be it a legal army

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:44.720
or criminal groups, like those who fight flying the banner of ISIS, Al Nusra, or other fanatical organizations.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:38:02.840
I think that preventive measures should focus on human aspects, as some of you said earlier.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:07.460
The ever-growing illusion constituted by the belief in technical measures,

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:12.200
apart from the fact that it is often not long in showing how absurd it is.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:23.000
We saw it in Viry-Chatillon, where drug dealers savagely attacked a police car

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:34.420
in order to intimidate and frighten them, since they deliberately tried to burn the policemen within the car.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:40.380
But the most terrifying aspect of this situation is that the policemen were supposed to keep a watch on a CCTV camera.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.640
Either the camera or policemen should keep a watch on drug dealers.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.880
But how could policemen keeping a watch on a camera that keeps a watch on drug dealers

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.520
find motivation to such an activity?

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.660
And how is such a system efficient?

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.880
We quickly understand that this situation is absurd.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:07.780
Human means always prevail, as was shown in this case, since policemen had to protcet a camera.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.160
This is also true for wiretapping.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:18.600
Wiretapping everyone, all the time, everywhere, for any reason,

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:25.760
even at the individual level, thanks to these tools that can no longer be opened...

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:32.280
Well this is a myth, for who can process such a quantity of information

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.080
collected by machines? Other machines! I know this.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:44.620
Let me remind you that I was the secretary of the Senate Armed Forces Committee.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.000
I know the drill.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.780
So machines wiretap, and other machines process the wiretapping.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:58.780
The French ambassador in a country that I won't reveal once told me not to say anything on the phone

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.520
- I don't know why he thought we had secrets to share on the phone -

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.860
because that would waste the machine's time.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:14.660
So I learned that what I said was wiretapped, even in this embassy. So I know the drill.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.880
We end up thinking that all this is an illusion, since no one can process so much information.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.300
Well, this is a mistake, you are taking the issue the wrong way,

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.840
meaning that if we need to know something about someone for well-founded or unfounded reasons,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:36.440
it is possible to trace all the information about this person, like his private conversations, in the blink of an eye.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.780
This is the way we should understand the gathering of information.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:46.240
And now, with the setting up of the giant file that was secretly decided by the government

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.920
during the school holidays of November,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:41:04.740
we will possess a huge quantity of information, gathered illegitimately, on such and such person.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.240
I will not go further on this issue.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:25.700
But I need to conclude by saying that if we want to get to the geopolitical root of the problem,

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:33.500
and if we think about the forms of the problem at the individual level in a serious way

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:43.440
- meaning we should avoid to think that reading a book, even more so a religious book, has the effect of

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:49.760
suddenly turning people into terrorists who kill their fellow citizens -

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:55.320
if we understand that a psychological journey leads to the criminal act,

00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:05.500
if we want to take preventive measures, if we want to refuse to concede political victories to our opponents,

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.680
then we should focus on the following points:

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:21.160
First, the political objective of terrorist attacks is to divide the French people along a religious line.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.700
Our priority is to avoid this division.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:38.660
Therefore, all those who want to establish a link between a religion and these behaviors, one way or another,

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:43.660
are in collusion with the enemy, because they make their task easier to achieve,

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:48.020
and because they justify the fantasies of those who think the two are connected.

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:54.260
The objective of the political fanatics is to draw a political programme from religion

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.260
of which they would become the only representatives.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.000
As we said it earlier, our friends fight against this everywhere.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.160
The majority of the victims of Islamism are in Muslim countries.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:13.560
In France, the first victims, on a psychological level, are Muslims.

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:18.460
They feel helpless and overwhelmed by a situation of which they are accused of being responsible,

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:27.900
while the most fragile Muslims among youngsters and psychotics and let us say it clearly, lousy individuals,

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:36.180
may feel represented by this form of criminality disguised as ideology.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:45.600
Secondly, the state must be officially republican.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:52.340
The Republic is not a neutral regime, it is not a cosumer item.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.500
We cannot channel-hop between the different compartments of the republican state, it's a whole set.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:02.460
The nation, the state, the Republic and citizenship are one and the same thing

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.260
in the French way of conceiving citizenship.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.920
I'm talking about France because it is the country where this idea has been developed the most,

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.840
in ways that were not all the time very clever,

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:20.640
and we have not always been the best guardians of this idea

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.100
since we sometimes did the opposite of what our motto meant.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:33.740
Anyway, we should not talk about the republican state only when we are dealing with policing tasks.

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:41.760
The organization we maintain is not an organization in general, but the republican organization, in which freedom prevails.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.800
First, the freedom of conscience, the mother of all other freedoms,

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:48.860
and second, the freedom of citizens.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.600
Therefore, betraying freedom on the pretext better fighting insecurity,

00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:00.520
a method that has never been efficient anywhere in the world, is an anti-republican attitude.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:06.200
We can win this battle without a state of exception.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:12.500
Besides, the state of emergency is used for any reason in an irresponsible way.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.920
Everyone knows that a state of emergency is useless three days after it was declared.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:22.440
The state of emergency has only one point, setting the cat among the pigeons, but there has to be pigeons.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.560
And if the state of emergency is permanent, then it's no longer a state of emergency,

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:31.400
because organized crime finds new ways of organizing.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:36.520
Besides what can you do then, declaring the state of over-emergency? The state of war? The state of exception?

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.460
The suspension of individual freedoms provided for in Article 16 of the Constitution?

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.540
Do we have to reach this point to understand that all this leads us nowhere?

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:54.980
It only unravels the cohesion and unity of the citizens, and their enthusiasm for defending what they believe in.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.840
This was what I wanted to tell you before the 13th of November,

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:05.560
about it, and about the following events, the events that took place this summer in particular.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:11.620
I have suffered too much that people think we were the careless ones about these issues.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:16.680
On the contrary, WE are very serious about them,

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:23.320
because none of the solutions of those who were in office worked, they fail over and over.

00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:33.940
The President may have killed four people, but the result here was not that impressive.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.360
I am barely ironic here.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:48.360
I want our fellow citizens to understand the seriousness of what is done in the name of a fight that is so wrongly led.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:59.320
One might think that we will win the battle against the fanatics in Syria in the following days.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:07.700
We hope that the great struggle of the Kurds and their allies will be a victory.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:15.780
France has no friends in this situation, it only has interests.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:22.080
and the interest of France is peace, quickly. The quicker the peace, the better we will be.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.360
There has to be peace.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:31.120
First, we have to eradicate the military presence of our enemies everywhere we can.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:38.040
And we will make them pay the crimes they committed against us, against unarmed people

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:43.760
who were taken by surprise and who had no belligerent attitude.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:52.940
I'll repeat what I said once in a TV show, these people are not fighters, they are murderers.

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:57.160
They do not deserve respect, they deserve to be treated for what they are.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.820
We need to show who and what they are: human wrecks.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:07.000
Their personal behavior and their life are pathetic

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.220
They go from an absurd offence to a ridiculous behavior.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.920
Such was the case for most of them, the heinous  assassin of Nice included

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:24.440
who, in addition to his revolver and to his criminal acts, possessed plastic toys.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.220
Well, this must be said.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:37.360
We hope that a decisive military victory in Syria and Iraq could lead to the holding of a conference

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.040
between all the parties involved and those responsible for the war,

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:46.120
those who give orders and those who finance armed groups included.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:50.240
Only a universal coalition can defeat our enemies.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:56.580
I bet that if such a coalition becomes a reality, our enemies will be destroyed,

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:04.060
because those who finance them will be part of the coalition, and as a consequence they will stop doing it.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:12.060
Then we will use the only means that we know of that could get the Syrian and Iraqi states working.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.120
And by states I mean states.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:21.340
We saw what was the result of a tribal organization of which we are unreasonably responsible

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.340
in Lybia and other countries.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:32.380
The only way that can get these states functioning are elections, imperfect though they might be.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.400
Please don't tell me that we don't know how to organize elections in Syria and Iraq.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:42.220
It wll take some time of course. We need a year to bring back people and to do the electoral registers again.

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:47.640
The only thing refugees want is to go back home.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:54.440
I think it is easier to organize elections, and to guarantee their democratic aspect, under the supervision of the UNO

00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.360
than doing war.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:07.260
I think it is easier to transport ballot boxes and electoral registers than missiles, bombs and planes,

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:13.620
and all these instruments that are very expensive to maintain.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:17.540
Someone once laughed at me on this issue.

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.840
Does anyone know any other way to organize a state than elections and democratic means?

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.200
What kind of benevolent dictatorship would you like to establish?

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:32.140
Have you ever seen armed missionaries that were greated by a population? When? In which historical period?

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:37.040
Have you forgotten the outcome of your wonderful crusade in Iraq?

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:44.060
You know, when the regime of Saddam Hussein was destroyed on the pretext of weapons of mass destruction

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.660
because it was undemocratic, while the "saviors" of Iraq were famous for being great democratic forces,

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:55.320
like the Qataris, the Saudis or the Emiratis, who,

00:50:55.320 --> 00:51:00.600
thirty years after this war began, just accepted a great democratic breakthrough I must admit,

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:05.020
allowing women to drive, on certain conditions, during certain hours!

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:10.560
Anyway. All this was a comedy that resulted in a disaster, and I pride myself that

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.560
I voted against the first Gulf War and those that followed.

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:20.880
All this must stop if we refuse that the world collapse in a global war

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.040
that would contaminate one country after the other,

00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:32.400
as was almost the case when the Turks irresponsibly shot down a Russian combat aircraft.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:38.920
At any moment, a provocation somewhere in the world can trigger a war, as history has shown.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:45.000
The French people must be independent. When France is independent, its voice is heard throughout the world.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.180
The French people must promote peace with all its energy.

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:55.060
Peace is the best way to eradicate terrorism.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:57.140
This is all for today.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:03.140
We will see each other again when we will introduce the workgroups in charge of the different reports

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:10.080
on which our policy will be based. Thank you for your attention, sorry for talking so much.
