00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.060
Hello, this is the 26th episode of the week review

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.560
You are 320,000 subscribers on this channel. You are my freedom

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.160
It's a means for me to express myself without being interrupted at every turn

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.300
to develop a thought  in more than a hundred and forty characters

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.100
With all of what a reasoning contains, that is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.280
Arguments, counter-arguments, answers to questions we sometimes ask to ourselves

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.980
They are often, the most difficult ones to solve

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.360
So, let's go. Opening !

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.260
So, I will obviously speak of Presidential Election

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.760
because it is a national event,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.200
international, I received message from all over the world

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.720
and also because we were really direct actors

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.280
You, who listen to me and me who speaks to you

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.180
the evening had a strange taste

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.740
I'll explain why

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.720
All along the day we had phone calls, from friends, saying

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.620
"what's happenning? We have been removed from electoral lists"

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
It created a strange atmosphere

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.000
Moreover, the weekbefore, we learnt that 500k people were registered twice

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.880
This is a rather special atmosphere

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.680
we are not used to that, in such an developped country

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.180
To seeing a mess like that in the organisation of electoral lists

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.140
so it creates an atmosphere a bit unwholesome

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.160
As far as the week-end was getting close, it became a banania republic

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.400
On public services (tv channel), there was a big report, the morning on the repression in Venezuela

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.780
And on an private tv channel,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.240
I saw there was a long interview of a biography of Mr Macron

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.160
And it explained, how was the guy, if he had grown well

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.140
It's not a good atmosphere, France is not used to be like that

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.340
It is more respectful, of the intermission/silence

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.240
everybody makes an effort to respect the rule,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.100
here apparently, the rule....

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:20.980
The afternoon, the research institutes, friendly called me, "It's really tight, there is no way to really know"

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.420
But at 8p.m., pof, everybody seemed to know

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.500
With two packages, with an enough big step, in order to make no ambiguity

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.620
But me, in this atmosphere, I chose to wait for

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.580
the results from the Home Office

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.960
because it was a ridiculous in a way

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.940
First you had all the old people, rush up to TV shows

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.220
some of whom we didn't even remember were still alive

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.220
And there they were explaining, giving advice on everything

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.940
especially on what WE have to do

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.420
then

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.740
despite everything

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.240
I did know it was a tantrum

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.220
and at the end we did well because it was really close

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.060
we were laking 620k voters

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.760
to reach the second round

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.800
because for the second rank, the first three did around 7 million votes

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.060
7 619 000 for Le Pen

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.980
7 200 000 for Fillon

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.440
7 060 000 for me

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.360
so as you can see

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.680
it was really close

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.260
so we did well to take our time and not to congrat the winner

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.380
Nevertheless, we lost!

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.620
that is to say, we not qualified for second round

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.800
Maybe the shock was harder for us than the other

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.100
because we felt we could do it!

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.300
we felt with strength

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.300
and one of the harbingers seen the lweek before

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.220
was the frenzy against me

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.980
ALBA, whatever, Venezuela, whatever, Russia

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.980
they were looking for anything they had in stock

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.920
to bring it back, but in reality , last week

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.100
they didn't fight against Le Pen, they did against ME

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.280
So, we felt that if they were that nervous, it was because we were really close

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.540
What was the influence of this frenzy? I don't know!

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.720
Whatever, for 620k vote

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.500
there will be no increase of the minimum wage

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.920
no 6th Republic

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.960
no referendum revocatory

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.720
no end to nuclear energy

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.080
There'll be no 100% renewable energy

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.260
There'll be no free organic canteen for children

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.920
And there'll be none of the propositions for peace.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.860
For sure, it let a sour taste

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.980
and we have the right to be disappointed

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.900
but mostly

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.100
what's the situation we are in?

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.700
everybody is in the fix

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.240
and urged to accept the only choice

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.040
and, don't be afraid, it is highly predicted that choice

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.080
to the point that this is not a choice anymore

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.120
so it's an extremely nervous situation given the violence that is done to most of us

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.900
And,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.280
from this violence, no stable situation can emerge

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.200
because the deep nature of the two actors of the second round

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.680
forbid that stability

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.860
First because he's far-markets

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.320
the other because she's far-right

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.240
but I let that topic for later on

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.640
because, that all, can't make us forget the magnitude of the success, we won

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.140
and for sure it is not done for 620k votes, but please, 38 departments

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.540
choose us for 2 second round

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.560
and, in, a lot of big French cities

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.860
we did results that rank us at the forefront

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.200
and cities from any political side of the fence concerning the mayors

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.040
it's not reserved to one specific category

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480
We are first in Montpellier

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And the mayor is Socialist

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.380
Lille, Socialist mayor

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.500
Montpellier 31.5%

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.500
Lille 29.9%

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.240
Le Havre, right-wing mayor, 29.8%

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.640
Ahead!

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.620
Toulouse, center mayor, 29.2%

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.920
Grenoble, the mayor, a friend of ours!

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.420
who voted for me, 28.9%

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.220
I stop with the political side, Avignon 28% ahead, Saint-Etienne 25% ahead,

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.420
MARSEILLE

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.620
MARSEILLE

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.420
25% ahead!

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.120
Nîmes 24%

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.940
And cities, in Paris suburbs

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.380
one is the record, I believe,

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.560
Gennevillier 47%

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.520
Courneuve 44%

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.020
 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.520
 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.020
 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.520
 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.020
 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.520
 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.020
 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.860
it amused me that we are ahead in Every

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.360
eh, it's to say, it happens to anybody, even Mr Valls, to look at me, in front of him

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.240
Roubaix, Tourcoing,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.520
And there are cities where - without being first -

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.700
we are still really high

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.900
really high

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.900
For exemples, Rennes 26%

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.520
Nante 25%

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.340
Amiens 25%

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.780
Besancon 25%

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.720
Clermont-ferrand 25%

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.240
Strasbourg 24%

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.960
Bordeaux 23%

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.520
Limoges 23%

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.700
Lyon 23%

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.840
Le Mans 22%

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.360
Dunkerque 22%

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.400
You see, it is extraordinary

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.160
It has been the steepest increase since 2012

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:52.060
And hum, for us it's not only the steepest increase

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.440
and being first in so many cities

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.700
Thus we reduced the gap with Mrs Lepen, in a spectacular way

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.200
We progressed of 75%, since 2012

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:10.560
and we shrank the gap with her because she progressed less fast than us.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.740
And you can see that, since beginning

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.680
The aim has been the reconquest of the people's confidence (low and middle classes)

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.200
they are the goal

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:28.600
Our politics, our program, is not for people who have big cars, yatch, big wallets

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.060
It is for brave and humble people

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.600
who just want to live decently with their wages or their pension

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.100
so it is heartbreaking for us

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.840
when she succeed in convincing them, sometimes she dissembles, dress up like us, and moves like us

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.900
she tries to do the Mélenchon, she says "this way we will dupe people"

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.600
But she's not the first to do that, Hollande did that too.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.080
He said I will implement a 75% tax, but he didn't even remember what he wanted to tax...

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.900
Anyway, it enabled him to attract some voters.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.620
And he said "Finance is my enemy! I will renegotiate European treaties!"

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.760
You remember all that right?

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.220
So it's not the first time that we are confronted with lies.
