00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
This is our 20th Weekly Press Review

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.420
Greetings from the train that's taking me from Paris to Marseille

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.120
to take part at the March 8th Women's Rights day, where I'll be participating.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080
As we're on the train, you may hear time to time some odd noises

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.880
from electromagnetic interference and else

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.240
So...

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.500
I want to take advantage of this Weekly Press Review to draw your attention to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.660
something in the campaign that didn't get a lot of notice

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.100
...like most of the events in this campaign

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.280
because these days, all we hear about is Mr. Fillon's justice misadventures

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.820
so say the show ongoing about criminal investigation of the right-wing candidate.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.740
So the point... That evening, Mr.Macron (other Pres candidat) was being interviewed

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.480
on the "France 2" public TV channel.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.980
by an incredibly indulgent journalist--to the extent that it was widely commented on the social media.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.880
The journalist, Mr Pujadas, was interviewing Mr. Macron, and during the interview

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.660
Macron started talking about pensions

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.700
rolling out all the usual clichés and all usual grass-less sentences

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.460
saying "No one can make heads or tails of the pension system"

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.960
I disagree, people understand the system quite well: it's a  mandatory state pension based on redistribution of contributions from those working to those in retirement and it's a bit different depending on the profession specific category.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.060
As You know your own retirement category, you are well informed.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.140
Mr Macron additional said:

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.160
"I propose, for every euro paid into the system every individual should have the same rights."

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.860
And no one is paying attention. Not Mr. Pujadas, who doesn't interrupt him or say:

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860
"What do you mean?"

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.800
So the guy keeps rolling out his idea and he gets to make out that this is a brand new idea

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.180
that it's fair, that it's balance.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.180
When in fact it's the opposite and it's an well known systeme

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.840
A points-based fund pension system, which would completely change the organization of our repartitions system

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.420
In that system, that is true, every euro paid in entitles you to the same benefit, regardless of who you are.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.980
But what he's not telling you, is that the pension you will be entitled to will vary from one year to the next one

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.140
depending on the value of the fund points you will have acquired by paying into the system

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.600
So contribute into the system, you gets points which have a given value

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.580
Let's say it's one euro per point

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.760
but the value will fluctuate from one year to the next, and why is that?

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.760
First you have to take into account your generation's  life expectancy.That's his proposal.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.200
Say you're born in 70

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.700
Your life expectancy isn't the same than if you were born in 72 or 73

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.440
So by this time we're wondering what life expectancy has to do with any of this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.640
What it means is that the greater your generation's life expectancy, the less you will be entitled to, because you're more expensive

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.280
That's a first source of inequality.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.040
The pivotal questioning now:

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.400
is not cause you're born the same year as someone that you've had the same life

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.640
and mostly the same kind of physical profession

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.340
Today, there is already a terrible gap between the life expectancy of labor workers and the management

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.980
It's a big difference, believe me.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.900
The average life expectancy of a blue-collar worker is 59 years!

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.520
It's much greater for white -collar, which aren't as physical by nature.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.180
So at first glance, Macron's pension measure seems egalitarian, but it's absolutely the opposite

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.880
Secondly

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.960
the value of each point will fluctuate depending on the salaries paid out

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.480
because your salary and life difficulty will determine how much and if you could save into the system

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.860
and the variation will depend mostly from a big salary

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.440
or a small one as you will have to decide how much you could save yourself.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.440
So when the time comes, they will tell you

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.480
"Now you can decide when you want to retire, at 62at the earliest

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.560
which is the minimum age today

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:56.540
according to the system set up first by Fillon, then by Hollande: 62 years old, 43 years of contribution. Already that's rough

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.400
So you can choose between that and retiring at over 67 or 68

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.600
And all of this is presented nicely, neatly, with a pretty red ribbon

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.620
They tell you "You can choose when you retire"

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.860
and all the dummies are saying "Great I get to decide."

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.420
First no one ever said you had to retire at a given age

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.880
In every profession, there's always the possibility to go beyond

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.700
and keep working after the legal Minimum retirement age

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.780
There are only a few professions where you cannot continue working after a certain age

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.280
And frankly, it's just safer for some, no?

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.840
There are jobs where it's probably not a good idea to keep working beyond 60 or 65 or 62, or whatever

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.240
And that's how this whole idea of a points-based pension system was covered by France 2

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.920
And no one realized what it actually meant.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:51.720
I wanted to tell you about it, because I don't think you should let run

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.700
a presidential campaign without intel,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.920
on the account of this nonsense

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.620
it's just a lot of spin, or "story telling"

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.720
Just to say, they're just trying to trick you

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.940
So, this attempt to fool the public by the beautiful young banker, with all his great ideas

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.740
who claims to want to free up society...Well it's all a bunch of stale rubbish

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.920
A points-based pension system means the end of the current pay-as-you-go system

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.340
The current system obviously has a number of drawbacks that we propose to fix

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.940
In any case, let me tell you what my position is:

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.460
I'm in favor of a return to the ability to retire at 60 with 40 years of contribution, and not one more.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.900
And I can tell you how I plan to finance it. I'll say again:

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.380
If women get the same salary as men for doing the same job,

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:46.080
the additional contributions will be enough to finance the ability to retire at 60 with 40 years of contribution

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.580
and I'm happy to be able to say that on my way to Marseille

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.520
to take part in the events on Women's Rights Day

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.000
That was my first topic.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.460
The second topic of the week, that no one has heard about

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.620
because the news channels have put a lid on anything that isn't related to Fillon's embezzlement issues

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.500
is something that's out of the ordinary

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.520
The four leading economies of the European Union

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.080
Germany, France, Italy and Spain

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.680
and their heads of state or government

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.640
met in, of all place, Versailles (Hollande couldn't think of a better place apparently).

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:29.420
Shows a lack of taste on the part of a Frenchman, but let's skip over the historical implications

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.900
because Hollande doesn't know a thing about French history. He's just not interested.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.540
He doesn't get the symbolic significance

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.420
So, there were four countries meeting just to pretend it wasn't in fact a meeting of two countries

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.100
And they each made a separate statement

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.840
If you were following this, you may have wondered why

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.920
Because the fact is that four countries are meeting to decide the future of Europe

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:00.720
forgetting the 24 other countries that are waiting at the door to hear about the decisions they made.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.920
That isn't exactly the most egalitarian approach to Europe, it's not in the European spirit

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.020
And here's what they decided: let's create a two-speed Europe!

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.140
That's going to be their big idea. So while they were doing that,

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.700
they were acting as if they were reinventing the wheel.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.660
Because, we already have a multi-speed Europe: we've got Schengen,

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.960
we've got the Euro zone; not all of Europe is in the Eurozone, and so on...

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.960
And there's yet another example, the Europe that currently discussing

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.920
a tax on financial transactions, what they used to call a Tobin tax.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.700
This has been going on for five years, it involves ten countries and we haven't gotten anywhere

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.880
And so that's their silver bullet, which is supposed to solve all of Europe's current problems

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.700
Naturally it won't solve anyone's problems, because it isn't the issue

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:59.120
Take the President of the French Republic

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.480
He wants to create a Eurozone parliament and a Eurozone government

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:09.000
(It's a proposal he made on July 14, 2016) taking into account the weight of each nation.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.940
But, what for? A Eurozone parliament, a Eurozone economic government, what for? To do what?

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.000
That apparels to be the Grand European Project: The Europe of Money

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.280
That's what it boils down to. And when it's not the Europe of Money, it's the Europe of War

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.940
And I want to tell you about it, because, on the day they were talking about Mr. Fillon,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:30.660
the day all TV cameras were filming the campaign headquarters of Les Republicains,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:36.880
at the same time, they did something they think they's gotten away with because no one noticed: the creation of a Military Staff

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.120
for the European Union, with its headquarters in Brussels

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.180
They starting out very quietly, but I ask you: What is this for?

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:47.220
They say it's the Europe of Defense, all the candidates are in favor of a Europe of Defense

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.920
You think "Europe of Defense". Sounds good! What a great idea.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.400
But that's the wrong reaction. The right question to ask is: Who is Europe defending against?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.040
Who are we supposed to be defending ourselves against? What commitments are you taking for each other?

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.460
If you create Europe of Defense, that means you intend to defend all the countries participating in the EU.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.120
Maybe, but that would be new for France.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.180
Our defense is not designed to take over the defense of Europe.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.840
It is designed to protect France's borders. If a country attacks us

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.400
we strike it hard, once and for all.  It is horrific, but that's what is known as nuclear dissuasion.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.420
It's debatable, but that's the system we have and that we've based our security on and it hasn't changed since General de Gaulle

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.080
It can be changed, but we have to talk about it. And it's not something you hear about in the press

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:43.200
When you create a Europe of Defense, you're telling everyone that we might possibly be fighting on European soil.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.380
This is the exact opposite of our definition of the defense of the French

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.460
It's a strange way to introduce the concept to call it Europe of Defense

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.680
What you're thinking is an independent Europe...But that's not it at all, you haven't been following:

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.800
Europe of Defense is actually within the framework NATO.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.440
In an interview to Le Monde, Hollande said

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.180
"We can relaunch Europe through a common defense." Now do you get it?

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:13.320
So he wants to relaunch Europe through Money and through the Military. magnificent! The opposite of what we want.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:19.160
We founded Europe for peace, especially between the French and the Germans, and let's check whether that hasn't changed

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:24.080
But we also built Europe to have peace with our neighbors. Now we're creating Europe of Defense to relaunch Europe.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.000
We built Europe so we could have a social Europe, and what do we get, the Europe of the euro.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.280
a European Central Bank whose statutes can never be changed

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.180
in charge only of keeping the currency stable, with no responsibility for jobs

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:42.080
with no concern for social harmonization or tax harmonization, because that's forbidden.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.540
So that's where we stand. And while all of these decisions are being made,

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:52.180
what are we talking about? Whether or not Mr. Fillon, or Mrs Fillon or the Fillon children or whatever

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:57.620
and the bickering among Les Républicains to decide whether or not Fillon should still be candidate

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.940
Frankly this smacks of a massive smokescreen to me

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:07.640
I want to make it clear, I said so during my press conference and I'll repeat it now: we are not committed by their decisions

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:16.040
The others had better know this up front: if I'm elected whatever they have decided does not concern me.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.080
And I don't think that the President of the Republic should be making that kind of commitment 50 days before the end of his term.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:28.340
François Hollande, who has already lied to everyone by saying he would renegotiate the European budget treaty, and who didn't renegotiate anything,

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:33.160
He should not be making decisions on our behalf, because it's not acceptable

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.540
If only out of courtesy for democracy in this country.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.880
But the other are no better. Look at the Italian President

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:47.200
He's facing a new general election in Italy.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.020
Why? because he took over a bit

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:56.820
haphazardly from Matteo Renzi, who recently lost a referendum in Italy.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.800
And Mr. Rajoy, the Spanish Prime Minister.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:10.080
He doesn't have a majority and no one knows how long he's going to last

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.960
Then there's Madame Merkel, who has a general election in September.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.780
All four are in a highly unstable democratic position

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.420
and yet they are making decisions they have no right making.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:28.420
They're making decisions that will have affect the next several years in the very last months of their terms.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.680
What they're saying is: I've made a decision, you deal with it.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.120
It's like Sarkozy who signed a budget treaty with Mme Merkel and, when Holland came to power,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.360
after telling us he was going to renegotiate, he said. France is committed by its signature.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.520
Well not me. Let me be clear about that.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:52.180
I'm telling you about that meeting in Versailles and about the new Military Staff

00:12:52.180 --> 00:13:00.020
because I am increasingly worried about the rising tensions in the world.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:08.840
I see more and more situations degenerating into head-on conflict

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.960
Once again, the USA is installing new antimissile missiles

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:19.200
to pretect South Korea from potential attacks from North Korea

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.500
At first sight, it sounds like a good idea. That way, North Korea won't be shooting at South Korea.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:32.680
But the end result is that those missiles are exactly the same as the ones we have installed in Europe.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.580
The US installed the missiles in Poland, claiming that they would protect Europe from missiles launched by Iran.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.120
Three years later, we signed an agreement with Iran, but the missiles are still there.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.460
The US has also deployed troops on the ground

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:52.140
In fact, they did that to threaten Russia

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.680
just as the missiles in South Korea are there to threaten China's defense, and that fosters tremendous tension in the region.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.520
Everyone is very worried and I'm very worried.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.640
I think that the situation...with a character like Mr. Trump...

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.600
Maybe he's just acting, maybe he's playing the tough guy, but that's not how you act in that kind of situation.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.700
You have to have an attitude that is clear, and understood by all.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:23.760
You don't want anyone to make a sudden gesture or anything that could totally disrupt the balance of peace.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:31.460
So that's it. I want to conclude on the Demonstration on March 18.We are organizing a March

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.580
from Bastille to République, in Paris to on the theme of the 6th Republic

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:42.280
That date is important for the type of campaign we are running

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:48.640
This is not just an electoral campaign. This is the political mobilization of the people to carry out a project.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.420
The campaign itself has to be part of the project.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:57.400
This march is our way of showing the top way out

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.040
from the current situation of political decomposition

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.880
The top way out means that the people will designate a Constituent Assembly

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.940
to redefine the rules of the game in our country

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.820
redefine the principles and the rights we recognize one another.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.400
And thus set a number of necessary rules: the right to recall elected officials,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:27.620
the right to make important decisions like making all people who have been convicted ineligible for life,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:34.520
whatever their crime, when it goes against republican virtue.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:44.080
For us, this March will be an event in the presidential campaign

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:53.520
But it will also be an event of political expression for the French people concerning their future.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.320
Those are the two aspects of the March on March 18

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:03.980
To get there you are invited to use whatever means at your disposal, including carpooling

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:10.120
On foot, for those who can, by carpool, and we will charter buses.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.760
You can come by train, but the Gare de Lyon will be closed that day,

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.980
I want to make sure you know that. The trains that normally go to Gare de Lyon

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.740
wil stop in Tremblay, I believe, and then, you have to get to Paris.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.920
So I know it's going to be a bit complicated, but not that complicated I hope.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.920
So if you want to take a bus, go to our website, jlm2017,

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.640
and find out where the buses are leaving from, because we've already started to centralize that.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.000
We're expecting to charter between 260 and 300 buses

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.160
Give or take. Between 260 and 300, so that everyone can come.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:58.860
You need to be careful. Naturally there's a fee to get on the bus, but there's a return ticket. We'll get you home. Now worries.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:06.720
But be careful, for some of us it may be too expensive. Some people may not have the money.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:13.820
If you are part of one of our support groups, if you want to contribute, let's make sure that

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.780
everyone who wants to can get on the bus and that no one is left behind,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.980
just because they can't afford to pay for the ticket.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:26.600
We need to take care of our friends and make sure that there are as many of us as possible.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.760
I need you to be as many as possible, because an idea like the 6th Republic

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.040
is not something you can support with a small demonstration. It's got to be powerful.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:43.540
Strong, powerful, they have to see a show of strength, and mostly that there is a majority

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:49.680
In my opinion, there is a majority in France to organize this Constituent Assembly and change the Republic.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.340
Let me say, and insist, that we will not change the constitution

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:59.660
on the basis of a proposal drafted by a group of experts, of buddies, like in 1958.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.380
When General de Gaulle asked Michel Debra and a few others to produce a draft constitution.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.460
And then, it's either a yes or a no vote. In fact there was no real discussion

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.260
Because it became a yes or no vote for or against General de Gaulle and no one bothered to find out

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.920
what was in the text, and those who did, who protested, weren't that many.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:23.960
There were some, like François Mitterrand and Mendès France, and the Communists, too, I think, were against the 5th Republic.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.180
Who was for at the time? The right and the Socialist Party at the time.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.060
They never missed an opportunity to show off and they were for the 5th Republic.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:38.640
It's natural that we are the one's defending the idea of the 6th Republic

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.520
It's not just an ideological whim put forward by a small group of people

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.280
The 6th Republic is at the heart of our strategy of a Citizen's Revolution. We are getting involved

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:56.240
We are minding our own business, we are redefining the rules of the game. This is why March 18 will be a great event.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:02.000
So for the history buffs, March 18 is the anniversary of the Paris Commune

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.100
A magnificent movement of resistance against the Prussian invasion

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:12.880
That's how it started. Then it became a social revolution not just in Paris,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:18.160
because people believe that the Commune only happened in Paris. In fact, therefore Communes that constituted themselves throughout the country.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:26.540
And they immediately took all sorts of decisions that were liberating, like secularity, compulsory public schools, etc, etc.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:31.440
Issues that became the political demands of all Republicans.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:37.880
And it wasn't that simple, as you know, because the repression that followed was ferocious.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:44.560
No one ever talks about that repression , but they must have shot between 20,000 and 30,000 in less than a week.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.840
When the Commune ended, most of the communards were shot. It was absolute terror.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:57.360
They weren't tried or anything. Just lined up against the wall and shot.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.440
So the Paris Commune belongs to all the French.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.520
Not just those with left-wing ideas, even if the Commune was largely initiated

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.140
by left-wing people, and almost exclusively for them, or those who would later become the left.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.860
All the same, it's part of the whole country's history. It wasn't just a bind riot.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:22.480
It started with resistance to an invasion and then, it became the expression of the people's will.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.360
Its desire for social equality and social liberty.So normally it should be a beautiful day for everyone.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.400
So goodbye for now, and remember the blue thumbs-up to boost the video if you enjoyed it!
